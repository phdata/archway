Archway is a self-service resource provisioning and management tool for Hadoop clusters. It takes care of creating
Hive databases, Kafka topics, and Yarn resource pools in a structured manner. It will also centrally manage role based
access control throught Sentry, including creating and managing the underlying LDAP/Active Directory
groups needed to make Sentry function.

Archway ensures that your cluster is secure and your users have access to the data they need to work as quickly as possible.
Archway automates tedious and error prone work that is needed to onboard users onto a cluster and manage changing membership.

Archway is an Apache 2 licensed application.

See the documentation folder [docs](./docs) for more information.
